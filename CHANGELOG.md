made the first version called `dmap` at https://github.com/codefromanywhere/actionschema.dmap

# 2024-12-30

âœ… decided to leave behind dmap and create something similar but purely focused around requests called `fetch-each`.

âœ… dmap support for string[] and RequestJson[] and with that, default (simple) retry behaviour.

âœ… allow dmap worker accept header with 'text/event-stream' and if so, last update being full JSON, and update each 500ms. use this in dmap fn and add logging.

âœ… in the intermediate updates, show status counts and status counts with retry, and total done %

âœ… resolve small error that caused the result not to be captured entirely

âœ… ensure chatcomletions post also parses and returns codeblocks

create a wrapper around fetchEach to easily do LLM prompts with POST to catch the codeblock

create a benchmark for complex structured output in codeblock across various LLMs with 1000 tries.

ensure the durable objects and queues get cleaned up nicely

ðŸ¤” may be nice? `fetchEach` with instant 202 and callback
